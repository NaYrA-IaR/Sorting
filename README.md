# Sorting

Here i have created normal sorting functions which shows the time taken by each sorting technique in the worst case !!  

Till now i have added only bubble , inertion and selection sort and the result is bubble sort takes the most time , then insertion and at last with the least time is selection .
Bubble sort is not adoptive itself we make it adoptive by adding a flag variable . Although it is stable .

Insertion Sort is both stable and adoptive on its own.
